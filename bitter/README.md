BitCamp demo app for play
=================================

<h1> Version 1 </h1>

Currently the app contains what we have covered in the past week doing Play!.
You can find a user model and post model with some naive security implemented.
Take a not of partial views such as navigation.scala.html, _userForm.scala.html and _postForm.scala.html.
You will see some inconsistency in handling some functionality, this is bad in the general case but here it server
to expose different ways to achieve the same thing.

Added contact form and connected the mailer-plugin. You should take a look at the conf/application.conf file.
